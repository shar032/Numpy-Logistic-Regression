# Numpy-Logistic-Regression

Regularized Logistic Regression in Numpy for Binary Classification of Material Phases (perovskite vs. non-perovskite) using Batch Gradient Descent and atomic feature inputs (ionic radii, covalent radii and electronegativity) of materials with a general ABX3 formula, where A and B are cations and X is an anion.
